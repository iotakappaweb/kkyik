# Kappa Kappa Psi Website

## Description
Hello! If you are reading this that means that you have either been elected to the position of Web Admin, or you have been selected to help develop our chapter's website! Congratulations! We as a chapter are always striving for the highest, and it is important that our website reflects that value. You have been given a very unique and exciting opportunity to make this website reflect not only the chapter, but yourself as well. It is truly an honor to be able to create something that so many people will have access to.

Our website contains a lot of information so don't be worried if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed. The main goal of the website is to have a place where recruits, membership candidates, brothers, and alumni can go to get a better idea of the fraternity and the chapter itself. It's a hub for information and news alike. This website should be properly maintained by the Web Admin throughout their term. Please know that if you find yourself struggling at all that there are always resources you can turn to.

## Important Notes
There are issues that are open under the "issues" tab. Please use it, it will make not only your life easier, but also the next Web Admin's as well. Logging issues is easy, and creating projects is easy as well. Please get acclimated to using these features to help preserve the longevity of site development. The previous Web Admin should have guided you on how to use this feature, and you should be prepared to explain how to use this feature to the next incoming officer. It is recommended to do this tutorial during the transition meeting with the incoming officer.

Netlify WILL automatically deploy the repository every now and then. Keep this in mind as you develop so that no test features find their way into the live website.

Git knowledge/Branching/Pull requests will be your best friend in keeping organized throughout the development of the site. The previous officer should give a basic tutorial on this as well.

## Development Instructions
There are no current set recommendations for how you program the website. Previous Web Admin's have programmed in VSCode and regularly tested the site to see how it performs, but this structure most likely will not always be the most efficient way of doing things. Find what works for you and run with it.

As previously mentioned, please use proper branching and pull request structure to implement new features. It makes for a good paper trail and prevents unwanted features from sneaking their way into the live website.

## Documentation Guidelines
If you think of a new feature... MAKE AN ISSUE! Even if you don't think you can implement it in the course of your term, log it. This way future Web Admin's can see what ideas are out there and decide for themselves if they should implement it or not.

If the readme can be improved in any way then do it! Always remember that you will not be the last person to read this, so put any advice you would have for them in here!
