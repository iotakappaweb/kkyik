                In 1990, Iota Kappa was colonized at Boise State University by Peter Arashiro, April Brobst, James
                Borton, Amy Baker, Patrick Clasby, Nadine Michalscheck, Jim Ostyn, Fransisco Outhet, Sarah Robertson,
                and Roberta Shimer. The ten original Founding Fathers were initiated on April 14, 1990. Their sponsor
                was David A. Wells, director of athletic bands and a member of Phi Mu Alpha.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Between 1990 and 1994, at least thirty-nine Boise State band members were brought into the Brotherhood.
                Unfortunately, records are incomplete and some known alumni are missing from the national scrolls; there
                is no way to know exactly how many members of Iota Kappa were initiated in those years. Official records
                of the chapter ceased in 1994, and the chapter folded on the campus sometime in 1995.

                In the spring of 2001, four Boise State band members resolved to improve the band program at BSU. Ryan
                Baker, who had been involved in Kappa Kappa Psi at Cal Poly, introduced the organization to Kate
                Hoffman, Thaddeus Marks, and Jeremy Mattern. After some discussion, the four decided that they wanted to
                bring ΚΚΨ back to Boise State.

            <p class="lead tab">
                Fortunately, the 2001 Western District Convention was a “Convention for Colonization”. A generous
                donation from David Wells allowed the four students to fly to Portland to spend a weekend with the
                District. After two sleepless nights, one banquet/dance, thousands of questions, four goofy hats, six
                pairs of frozen underwear, and one triumphant fight song competition, the Boise State representatives
                were convinced to colonize.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                That summer marked a period of enthusiastic preparation. Ryan, Kate, Thaddeus, and Jeremy met monthly to
                discuss plans for the upcoming academic year, and to lay the foundation for the colonization process.
                They spoke with the music department faculty members about their plans to reactivate ΚΚΨ and met with
                student government officers to discuss becoming an official ASBSU club. A constitution was drafted, and
                informational flyers were produced and sent out with other band mailings. The group became an official
                organization and began to recruit interested parties.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Heavy recruitment for people to help build a chapter began during marching band camp and continued
                throughout the first few weeks of concert, jazz, and marching band rehearsals. Recruitment culminated on
                September 8th when the Washington State University football team brought its band – and consequently,
                ΚΚΨ and ΤΒΣ chapters – to Boise State. The fledgling group planned a pizza party and informational
                meeting at WSU’s hotel after the game. The event was a great success. Sixteen representatives from WSU
                and UCLA, including four district officers, spent the evening discussing the organizations with fifteen
                students from Boise State.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                After giving the issue considerable thought, the new group decided to colonize only the fraternity. On
                October 7th, ten BSU band members met and held elections for ΚΚΨ offices. Ryan Baker was elected
                president; Kate Hoffman, vice president; Thaddeus Marks, secretary; Jeremy Mattern, treasurer; Amanda
                Swan, historian; and Bonnar Bray, alumni secretary. In the weeks that followed, the group solidified
                with a membership of eleven, including Douglas Crowell, Olivia Cunningham, Kimberly Detro, Lindsey
                Hazelwood, and Tim Imlay. David Wells unreservedly agreed to once again become the group’s official
                advisor and sponsor.

                Iota Kappa became an official colony of Kappa Kappa Psi on October 19th, 2001. The following day, the
                colony carried out its first major service project: facilitating the District III High School Marching
                Band Competition at which they served as guides, ushers, runners, medics, transportation coordinators,
                adjudication assistants, warm up area supervisors, and general labor. They also supervised the
                pre-competition rehearsals on the “Smurf Turf”, representing school and fraternity from 7 am to 11 pm.
                As a result of their efforts, the 2001 DIII festival was the most expeditious in the festival’s history.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Iota Kappa spent the spring of 2002 preparing for convention and initiation into the fraternity. In
                February, they met with ASBSU and were awarded $1000 in matching funds for the upcoming school year. On
                March 10th the members completed their Membership Education Program. They wrapped up production of a
                seventy-page, full-color petitioning document and on March 21 sent it and their MEP plan to National
                Headquarters. In preparation for Convention, the colony assembled a scrapbook and build an
                eight-foot-tall Parthenon-esque chapter display, as well as developing a bid to publish the Accent.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                On April 5, 2002, the members of Iota Kappa underwent third degree, and the colony became an active
                chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi in front of over three-hundred Brothers and Sisters. The new chapter was
                awarded the Chapter Distance Award, got Psi’s goat, and lost its president’s pants.

                That summer, the chapter met to plan their first official Rush. It was privileged to be chosen as the
                host for the summer District Officers’ Meeting and first annual summer leadership retreat. Iota Kappa
                adopted a mascot, Thunder, as well. In late June, Iota Kappa served as volunteer staff for the Idaho
                All-Star Marching Band, chaperoning and assisting over one-hundred high school students in the audition
                and performance for the 2004 Rose Bowl Parade.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In 2002, Ryan Baker returned as president, Kate Hoffman as vice president, and Amanda Swan as historian.
                They were joined by Tim Imlay as secretary, Thaddeus Marks as treasurer, and Kim Detro as alumni
                secretary.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                2002 Rush began in September with a variety of events, including a pizza party, a moonlit barbeque in
                the park, and a video scavenger hunt that encompassed the entire city, including one member’s lingerie
                drawer (perpetuating the chapter’s legendary obsession with underwear). Iota Kappa successfully
                recruited over a dozen potential members, and interviews were underway by October. At the Blue Thunder
                Band Banquet, the chapter presented the first annual Arsis Award to Alisa Nicholls for outstanding
                attitude, enthusiasm, and aspirations.

            <p class="lead tab">
                Ultimately, nine Betas made it through the Membership Education Program and became Brothers on February
                12, 2003. The president of the Beta Class was Kerry Detro; vice president, Sarah Dyer; secretary, Cindy
                Knight; and treasurer, Chris Gallagher. The Beta Class also included Jonathan Alexander, John Duff, Jeff
                Gander, Thom Imlay, and Eric Turner.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In the spring of 2003, the chapter was awarded $1500 in matching funds from ASBSU. In March, Iota Kappa
                traveled to Western District Convention, where it was presented with the “Fight Songs of the West” award
                for most spirited performance of a fight song, as well as the Chapter Participation award.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                As Iota Kappa worked on its growth as a chapter, its members were also striving for the highest. New
                member Eric Turner landed an internship at Disney World and left for several months to pursue an
                adventure in Florida. His fellow Beta, Thom Imlay, made the Blue Devils and relocated to Concord, CA,
                for the chance of a musician’s lifetime. Chapter vice president Kate Hoffman was the recipient of the
                Western District’s Ideal Active Achievement Award and was named as a winner of the National AEA
                Scholarship for 2003.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In April, the chapter geared up once more for officer elections. Following elections, Kerry Detro was
                named president, and Jeff Gander became vice president. Sarah Dyer was elected secretary; Thaddeus
                Marks, treasurer; Kate Hoffman, historian; and Ryan Baker, alumni secretary.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In the summer of 2003, the chapter initiated its first honorary members: David Wells, Iota Kappa sponsor
                and director of athletic bands; Douglas Whitten, assistant Blue Thunder director and newly-appointed
                marching band director at the University of Pittsburg – Kansas; and Charles P. Ruch, Boise State
                President. That summer, Kate was the keynote speaker at the National convention, held in Norfolk, VA.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In August, the chapter held a camping retreat to plan Rush, which commenced during band camp and was
                completed on September 24. On October 1, 2003, Iota Kappa welcomed sixteen prospective members to the
                Gamma Class. The Gamma Class officers were Chase Glorfield, the Chase; Justin Black, the Justin; Leah
                Evans, the Leah; and Karen Kaupp, the Karen. Ultimately, on January 24, 2004 Iota Kappa initiated
                thirteen new members, including Carolina Diaz-Topete, Dustin Johnson, McLane Peterson, Eric Schlecte,
                Mary Simpson, Jarod Sorum, Kirstie Williams, Joe Ziegler, and Rachel Wong. Initiated with the class was
                honorary member, Todd Hill.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In the spring of 2004, sixteen members of Iota Kappa once again traveled to Western District Convention,
                this time in Santa Clara, CA. The end of the spring semester meant saying goodbye to fifteen Brothers
                who became alumni for various reasons.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                The summer of 2004 proved to be fruitful, with several summer meetings resulting in a Code of Conduct,
                an exciting retreat, and a plan for Rush. In August, Rush began, and was concluded on October 6th, with
                the presentation of bids. On October 13th, Iota Kappa welcomed twelve enthusiastic prospective members
                to the Delta Class. On November 6th, honorary members Marcellus Brown and Jeanne Belfy were initiated
                into the chapter.
