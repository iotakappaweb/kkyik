                In 1990, Iota Kappa was colonized at Boise State University by Peter Arashiro, April Brobst, James
                Borton, Amy Baker, Patrick Clasby, Nadine Michalscheck, Jim Ostyn, Fransisco Outhet, Sarah Robertson,
                and Roberta Shimer. The ten original Founding Fathers were initiated on April 14, 1990. Their sponsor
                was David A. Wells, director of athletic bands and a member of Phi Mu Alpha.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Between 1990 and 1994, at least thirty-nine Boise State band members were brought into the Brotherhood.
                Unfortunately, records are incomplete and some known alumni are missing from the national scrolls; there
                is no way to know exactly how many members of Iota Kappa were initiated in those years. Official records
                of the chapter ceased in 1994, and the chapter folded on the campus sometime in 1995.

                In the spring of 2001, four Boise State band members resolved to improve the band program at BSU. Ryan
                Baker, who had been involved in Kappa Kappa Psi at Cal Poly, introduced the organization to Kate
                Hoffman, Thaddeus Marks, and Jeremy Mattern. After some discussion, the four decided that they wanted to
                bring ΚΚΨ back to Boise State.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Fortunately, the 2001 Western District Convention was a “Convention for Colonization”. A generous
                donation from David Wells allowed the four students to fly to Portland to spend a weekend with the
                District. After two sleepless nights, one banquet/dance, thousands of questions, four goofy hats, six
                pairs of frozen underwear, and one triumphant fight song competition, the Boise State representatives
                were convinced to colonize.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                That summer marked a period of enthusiastic preparation. Ryan, Kate, Thaddeus, and Jeremy met monthly to
                discuss plans for the upcoming academic year, and to lay the foundation for the colonization process.
                They spoke with the music department faculty members about their plans to reactivate ΚΚΨ and met with
                student government officers to discuss becoming an official ASBSU club. A constitution was drafted, and
                informational flyers were produced and sent out with other band mailings. The group became an official
                organization and began to recruit interested parties.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Heavy recruitment for people to help build a chapter began during marching band camp and continued
                throughout the first few weeks of concert, jazz, and marching band rehearsals. Recruitment culminated on
                September 8th when the Washington State University football team brought its band – and consequently,
                ΚΚΨ and ΤΒΣ chapters – to Boise State. The fledgling group planned a pizza party and informational
                meeting at WSU’s hotel after the game. The event was a great success. Sixteen representatives from WSU
                and UCLA, including four district officers, spent the evening discussing the organizations with fifteen
                students from Boise State.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                After giving the issue considerable thought, the new group decided to colonize only the fraternity. On
                October 7th, ten BSU band members met and held elections for ΚΚΨ offices. Ryan Baker was elected
                president; Kate Hoffman, vice president; Thaddeus Marks, secretary; Jeremy Mattern, treasurer; Amanda
                Swan, historian; and Bonnar Bray, alumni secretary. In the weeks that followed, the group solidified
                with a membership of eleven, including Douglas Crowell, Olivia Cunningham, Kimberly Detro, Lindsey
                Hazelwood, and Tim Imlay. David Wells unreservedly agreed to once again become the group’s official
                advisor and sponsor.

                Iota Kappa became an official colony of Kappa Kappa Psi on October 19th, 2001. The following day, the
                colony carried out its first major service project: facilitating the District III High School Marching
                Band Competition at which they served as guides, ushers, runners, medics, transportation coordinators,
                adjudication assistants, warm up area supervisors, and general labor. They also supervised the
                pre-competition rehearsals on the “Smurf Turf”, representing school and fraternity from 7 am to 11 pm.
                As a result of their efforts, the 2001 DIII festival was the most expeditious in the festival’s history.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Iota Kappa spent the spring of 2002 preparing for convention and initiation into the fraternity. In
                February, they met with ASBSU and were awarded $1000 in matching funds for the upcoming school year. On
                March 10th the members completed their Membership Education Program. They wrapped up production of a
                seventy-page, full-color petitioning document and on March 21 sent it and their MEP plan to National
                Headquarters. In preparation for Convention, the colony assembled a scrapbook and build an
                eight-foot-tall Parthenon-esque chapter display, as well as developing a bid to publish the Accent.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                On April 5, 2002, the members of Iota Kappa underwent third degree, and the colony became an active
                chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi in front of over three-hundred Brothers and Sisters. The new chapter was
                awarded the Chapter Distance Award, got Psi’s goat, and lost its president’s pants.

                That summer, the chapter met to plan their first official Rush. It was privileged to be chosen as the
                host for the summer District Officers’ Meeting and first annual summer leadership retreat. Iota Kappa
                adopted a mascot, Thunder, as well. In late June, Iota Kappa served as volunteer staff for the Idaho
                All-Star Marching Band, chaperoning and assisting over one-hundred high school students in the audition
                and performance for the 2004 Rose Bowl Parade.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In 2002, Ryan Baker returned as president, Kate Hoffman as vice president, and Amanda Swan as historian.
                They were joined by Tim Imlay as secretary, Thaddeus Marks as treasurer, and Kim Detro as alumni
                secretary.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                2002 Rush began in September with a variety of events, including a pizza party, a moonlit barbeque in
                the park, and a video scavenger hunt that encompassed the entire city, including one member’s lingerie
                drawer (perpetuating the chapter’s legendary obsession with underwear). Iota Kappa successfully
                recruited over a dozen potential members, and interviews were underway by October. At the Blue Thunder
                Band Banquet, the chapter presented the first annual Arsis Award to Alisa Nicholls for outstanding
                attitude, enthusiasm, and aspirations.

            <p class="lead tab">
                Ultimately, nine Betas made it through the Membership Education Program and became Brothers on February
                12, 2003. The president of the Beta Class was Kerry Detro; vice president, Sarah Dyer; secretary, Cindy
                Knight; and treasurer, Chris Gallagher. The Beta Class also included Jonathan Alexander, John Duff, Jeff
                Gander, Thom Imlay, and Eric Turner.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In the spring of 2003, the chapter was awarded $1500 in matching funds from ASBSU. In March, Iota Kappa
                traveled to Western District Convention, where it was presented with the “Fight Songs of the West” award
                for most spirited performance of a fight song, as well as the Chapter Participation award.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                As Iota Kappa worked on its growth as a chapter, its members were also striving for the highest. New
                member Eric Turner landed an internship at Disney World and left for several months to pursue an
                adventure in Florida. His fellow Beta, Thom Imlay, made the Blue Devils and relocated to Concord, CA,
                for the chance of a musician’s lifetime. Chapter vice president Kate Hoffman was the recipient of the
                Western District’s Ideal Active Achievement Award and was named as a winner of the National AEA
                Scholarship for 2003.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In April, the chapter geared up once more for officer elections. Following elections, Kerry Detro was
                named president, and Jeff Gander became vice president. Sarah Dyer was elected secretary; Thaddeus
                Marks, treasurer; Kate Hoffman, historian; and Ryan Baker, alumni secretary.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In the summer of 2003, the chapter initiated its first honorary members: David Wells, Iota Kappa sponsor
                and director of athletic bands; Douglas Whitten, assistant Blue Thunder director and newly-appointed
                marching band director at the University of Pittsburg – Kansas; and Charles P. Ruch, Boise State
                President. That summer, Kate was the keynote speaker at the National convention, held in Norfolk, VA.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In August, the chapter held a camping retreat to plan Rush, which commenced during band camp and was
                completed on September 24. On October 1, 2003, Iota Kappa welcomed sixteen prospective members to the
                Gamma Class. The Gamma Class officers were Chase Glorfield, the Chase; Justin Black, the Justin; Leah
                Evans, the Leah; and Karen Kaupp, the Karen. Ultimately, on January 24, 2004 Iota Kappa initiated
                thirteen new members, including Carolina Diaz-Topete, Dustin Johnson, McLane Peterson, Eric Schlecte,
                Mary Simpson, Jarod Sorum, Kirstie Williams, Joe Ziegler, and Rachel Wong. Initiated with the class was
                honorary member, Todd Hill.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In the spring of 2004, sixteen members of Iota Kappa once again traveled to Western District Convention,
                this time in Santa Clara, CA. The end of the spring semester meant saying goodbye to fifteen Brothers
                who became alumni for various reasons.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                The summer of 2004 proved to be fruitful, with several summer meetings resulting in a Code of Conduct,
                an exciting retreat, and a plan for Rush. In August, Rush began, and was concluded on October 6th, with
                the presentation of bids. On October 13th, Iota Kappa welcomed twelve enthusiastic prospective members
                to the Delta Class. On November 6th, honorary members Marcellus Brown and Jeanne Belfy were initiated
                into the chapter.

                The Delta Class worked diligently to become active members, despite a change in vice president from Joe
                Ziegler to Karen Kaupp. On January 12th, 2005, Iota Kappa was incredibly proud to grant active
                membership to nine new members: Will Emerson, Amy Flynn, Ashley Isaak, Chris Pohl, Courtney Hoirup,
                Jason Durand, Becca Ahern, Nick Kovach, and Nathan Trujillo.

                Immediately following third degree, on the weekend of January 14th, Iota Kappa hosted District
                Leadership Conference at Boise State. The conference was a smashing success, hosting sixty Brothers and
                Sisters from around the Western District. Following DLC, Iota Kappa traveled to Pullman, WA for
                Northwest States’ Days. Iota Kappa was well represented, with fifteen members attending. Upon receiving
                an invitation from Utah, Iota Kappa also traveled to Logan, UT for Utah State Days. Iota Kappa brought
                eight people to Logan to support Iota Iota.

            <p class="lead tab">
                District Convention 2005 was held in Tucson, AZ. Iota Kappa rented a bus in order to transport as many
                people as possible to convention. Eleven members from Iota Gamma and Theta Delta, seventeen members of
                Iota Kappa, and two Iota Kappa Alumni took the twenty-one hour journey to Tucson to represent the
                Northwest corner of the District. At this convention, in addition to the normal tomfoolery that
                convention entails, Iota Kappa bid to host convention, and had a member run for a district office. Jeff
                Gander won the office of vice president, becoming the first member of Iota Kappa to hold a district
                office.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Iota Kappa, meanwhile, had been honored by Nationals, receiving a nomination for the William A. Scroggs
                (chapter of the Biennium) Award. In order to be considered, Iota Kappa was required to send a
                representative to present a bid of sorts, telling what the chapter has done, and what the chapter plans
                to do in the future. Iota Kappa sent a delegation of six to Lexington, KY. Mary Simpson, Karen Kaupp,
                and Jeff Gander presented the William A. Scroggs bid. McLane Peterson, Will Emerson, and Chris Pohl also
                made the trip, attending workshops, selling merchandise, and networking with people from around the
                nation and making contacts within our district.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Upon returning from this trip, Iota Kappa began planning for band camp, and recruitment. Plans for
                recruitment activities were much the same, but included the recruitment of a Tau Beta Sigma chapter for
                Boise State. The recruitment events were successful, with a wide variety of interested persons signing
                up for interviews. Iota Kappa narrowed their prospects to eight Kappa Kappa Psi prospectives, and
                extended invitations to nine people interested in Tau Beta Sigma.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Ultimately, on September 28th, 2005, Iota Kappa put class president Meredith Hoffman, class vice
                president Ryan Wells, class secretary/treasurer Peter Shuffler, class historian Sara Boyer, and Heather
                Barton, Josh Borden, Kayleigh Killeen, and Nick Washington through first degree, making them prospective
                members of Iota Kappa. An official colony of Tau Beta Sigma was formed on campus, led by colony
                president Leanne Spinazola, colony vice president Danny O’Berry, colony secretary/treasurer Britany
                Pugsley, colony historian Joanne Dunmire, and Caitlin Lapinel, Joel Delight, Cherish Potter, and Ben Van
                Hoogen.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                On December 3, 2005, the Epsilon Class of Iota Kappa – consisting of Meredith Hoffman, Ryan Wells, Peter
                Shuffler, Sara Boyer, Kayleigh Killeen, and Nic Washington - was initiated into the fraternity.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                At the end of the 2005-06 school year, Iota Kappa elected Jeff Gander as its President. The other
                officers were Nick Kovach as Vice President of Membership, Ryan Wells as Vice President of Service, Mary
                Simpson as Secretary/Treasurer, and Meredith Hoffman as Corresponding Historian.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Recruitment for the Eta Class began with band camp in August of 2006. Unfortunately, the Tau Beta Sigma
                colony folded over the course of the summer, and all but one colonist went their separate ways. Britany
                Pugsley pursued membership in Kappa Kappa Psi and was initiated as a one-person Zeta Class on October
                14, 2006.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                The Eta Class consisted of 13 band members: Stephen Barrett, Katie Burdick, Jason Davis, Angelica
                Garcia, Sarah Goodenow, Ashley Houser, Aaron Messinger, BJ Mickels, Brad Paine, Rod Royce, Sam Stone
                III, Pamela Walker, and Karla Walwer. They were initiated on December 2, 2006 – just in time to meet
                Brothers from the University of Oklahoma at the historic Fiesta Bowl. The Etas were also excited to be
                part of the chapter in time to co-host the Western District Convention for Colonization, in Las Vegas,
                the following spring. At convention, the chapter initiated Hannah Sutcliffe as its Theta Class on April
                14, 2007. Iota Kappa was also awarded the right to host the 2008 Western District Convention back home
                in Boise.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Riding on the adrenaline high of a successful convention, Iota Kappa held officer elections that spring.
                Nick Kovach ascended to the Presidency, and Meredith Hoffman became Vice President of Membership. Pammy
                Walker was elected as Vice President of Service and Angelica Garcia as Secretary/Treasurer. The position
                of Corresponding Historian remained open, until a later date, when Hannah Sutcliffe was elected to the
                board.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In the summer of 2007, Iota Kappa sent six members to National Convention in Orlando, Florida. They were
                Nick Kovach, Meredith Hoffman, Pammy Walker, Angelica Garcia, Aaron Messinger, and Douglas Crowell. Nick
                Kovach sat as chapter delegate.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Autumn of 2007 brought new opportunities and possibilities. Iota Kappa gave out bids to twenty people,
                putting fifteen through Third Degree. Jennifer Barrett, Steven Blake, Clay Butler, Keegan Condie, Nicole
                Frane, Jen Held, Julia Huglin, Melane Lyon, Nathan Mallon, Kiwi McCoy, Becky Thomson, Mallory Townsend,
                Carly Vaughn, Tyler Waggoner, and Richard Welker were initiated as the Iota Class into the chapter on
                December 8th. The officers of the Iota Class were Becky Thomson as President, Nicole Frane as Vice
                President, Keegan Condie as Secretary, and Jennifer Barrett as Historian. The spring class brought
                Dallas Grossaint, the lone Kappa member, into Iota Kappa. The chapter hosted the 2008 District
                Convention, and was also appointed the Big Brother Chapter for the colony at the University of Oregon.
                Members of the chapter traveled out to a local high school, where they succeeded in reinstating the band
                program that had been previously cut.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Elections were held, and Stephen Barrett was elected as President to the chapter. Meredith Hoffman was
                re-elected to Vice President of Membership, Amy Joy Flynn became the new Vice President of Service,
                Nicole Frane took the position of Secretary/Treasurer, and Jen Held was elected as Corresponding
                Historian.

                The fall semester of 2008 began with a beautiful sunrise for Iota Kappa. Sixteen Lambdas - Brittany
                Brown, Jeanette McMillan, Julia McCoy, Bess Oliver, Alex Ballantyne, Robert Brings, Nicole Bunnell,
                Andrew Clark, Loren Davis, Chase Huffman, Alex Lundquist, Rachel Kyle, Aubrey Morris, Keegan Sablan,
                Kris Walker, and Mark Young II - were initiated into the chapter in November, after going through the
                Membership Education Program and ULTRA. Lavaughn Wells and Jim Jirak, as well, were initiated as
                honorary members of Kappa Kappa Psi.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                The chapter continued its service to bands by hosting District Three Marching Band Competition and
                States Days, and by revitalizing diminishing band programs and supporting thriving ones. Leadership for
                the coming year was voted upon, as Iota Kappa elected Amy Joy Flynn as President, Aaron Messinger as
                Vice President of Membership, Brittany Brown as Vice President of Service, Julia McCoy as Secretary,
                Alex Ballantyne as Treasurer, Jen Held as Corresponding Historian, and Meredith Hoffman as
                Alumni/Interchapter Relations Officer.

            <p class="lead tab">
                In the Spring of 2009, Iota Kappa held a retirement party for their beloved sponsor, David A. Wells. The
                semester ended with Dave's sunset, when he passed away on May 3, 2009.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                Blue Thunder, Iota Kappa, and all of Dave's friends and family lost a great man that day, but nobody has
                lost his love or their memories. The chapter learns more and more everyday, from Dave's never-ending
                presence and his dream, and as we move into a new semester and year of opportunities, we will continue
                to grow and strive higher than we have before.
            </p>
            <p class="lead tab">
                In Fall of 2009, Iota Kappa initiated a class of ten members. Leonardo Escobar, Ashley Glover, Robert
                Gras, Amanda Harris, Matt Huston, Erik Mars, Cody McDaniel, Peter Rundquist, Jeremy Ruth, Jade Wheatley,
                Daniel Wiley, and Thomas Garrigus were initiated into the Mu Class. Dr. Nathan Stark, interim director
